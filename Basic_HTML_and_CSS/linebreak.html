<p>two roads diverged in a yellow wood<br>and sorry i could not travel both
<br>and be one traveller, long i stood<br>and looked down one as far as i 
could<br>to where it bent in the undergrowth;<br><br>then took the other,
as just as fair,<br>and having perhaps the better claim,<br>because it was
grassy and wanted wear;<br>though as for that the passing there<br>had worn
them really about the same,<br><br>and both that morning equally lay<br>in
leaves no step had trodden black.<br>oh,i kept the first for another day!
<br>yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>i doubted if i should ever come
back.<br><br>i shall be telling this with a sigh<br>somewhere ages and ages
hence:<br>two roads diverged in a wood,and i-<br>i took the one less
traveled by,<br>and that has made all the difference.
